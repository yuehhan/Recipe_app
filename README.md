This is a recipe app that I created to learn and practice Javascript and React. It is only a front-end app for now and is not connected to any databases. However, it uses the edamam.com recipe API. You can find a link to this app from my personal website at yuehwhan.com. 

Search a recipe and try it out. Thank you for visiting!
